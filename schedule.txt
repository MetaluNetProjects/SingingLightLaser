# The scheduler reads blocks between lines starting with 'date'.
# It will use the last block that has a 'date' lower than or equal to present date.
# Date format is: date DAY MONTH (e.g "date 24 12" is december 24th)
#
# In this block, lines starting with 'hours' will apply to all days defined in the
# last preceding line starting with 'days'.
#
# The scheduler is OFF at any other time. For instance, if the block is empty,
# the scheduler will be off for all this period.
#
# Lines that start with a '#' aren't read by the scheduler.

# Example:
#    days 3             # 3 = Wednesday
#    hours 10 00 18 00  # start_hour start_min stop_hour stop_min
#    days 6 7           # Saturday Sunday
#    hours 14 00 18 00  #
# In this example, the scheduler is ON Wednesday between 10:00 and 18:00,
# and Saturday and Sunday between 14:00 and 18:00.
